## Introduction

This is my keras implementation for this  paper:

> Sun J, Tian Z, Fu Y, et al. Digital twins in human understanding: a deep learning-based method to recognize personality traits[J]. International Journal of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, 2020: 1-14.

The code has been tested running under Python 3.6. The required packages are as follows:

- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- sklearn
- keras
- tensorflow

## Dataset

Three files are needed in the data folder

- raw_data
- glove.6B.300d.txt
- item.100d.txt
